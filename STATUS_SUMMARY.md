# TestForge - Quick Status Summary

> **Generated**: 2026-02-12
> **Status**: 🟢 **85% Complete - Ready for Testing**

## 🎯 Current State

**TestForge MVP is nearly complete!** All core functionality has been implemented and is ready for testing.

### What Works ✅
- ✅ Create Services, Features, Scenarios hierarchically
- ✅ Visual scenario editor with drag-and-drop steps
- ✅ Execute tests with Playwright browser automation
- ✅ Multi-layer selectors (6 strategies: testId → role → text → label → css → xpath)
- ✅ Self-Healing: Auto-detect when elements change and try fallback strategies
- ✅ Healing approval workflow with confidence scoring
- ✅ Reusable components with parameter binding
- ✅ API testing (HTTP requests + response validation)
- ✅ Real-time test execution with Server-Sent Events
- ✅ Screenshot capture and display
- ✅ Scenario duplication

### What's Missing ⚠️
- ⚠️ Search/filtering (only healing page has it)
- ⚠️ Element Registry (tracks element changes - not yet implemented)
- ⚠️ Some features not tested (component usage tracking)
