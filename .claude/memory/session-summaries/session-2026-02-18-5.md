# Session 2026-02-18 (Session 5)

## Summary
Autonomous development cycle. Project was already 95% complete.
Pushed pending commit, then added unit tests for engine.ts pure functions.

## Completed
- Pushed f5d7522 (lint cleanup) to origin/main
- Added 34 new unit tests for TestExecutor pure methods in `engine.test.ts`
- Fixed typecheck issue (missing `createdAt` in StepResult test fixture)
- Committed and pushed: a6feb78

## Files Changed
- `packages/core/src/executor/engine.test.ts` — NEW (381 lines, 34 tests)

## Tests
- **149 tests total** (was 115), 0 failures
- Typecheck: ✅ Pass
- Build: ✅ Pass (server + web)
- Lint: 0 errors, 163 warnings (all no-explicit-any)

## Key Pattern Learned
To test private methods in TypeScript without modifying the class:
```typescript
class TestableSubclass extends OriginalClass {
  public testMethod(...args) {
    // @ts-expect-error accessing private method for testing
    return this.privateMethod(...args);
  }
}
```

## Next Priority
- Manual QA — test all features end-to-end
- Fix any bugs found during QA
- Ready for internal alpha release
